SGX selftests

The SGX selftests includes a c program (test_sgx) that covers basic user space
facing APIs and a shell scripts (run_sgx_cg_selftests.sh) testing SGX misc
cgroup. The SGX cgroup test script requires root privileges and runs a
specific test case of  the test_sgx in different cgroups configured by the
script. More details about the cgroup test can be found below.

All SGX selftests can run with or without kselftest framework.

WITH KSELFTEST FRAMEWORK
=======================

BUILD
-----

Build executable file "test_sgx" from top level directory of the kernel source:
 $ make -C tools/testing/selftests TARGETS=sgx

RUN
---

Run all sgx tests as sudo or root since the cgroup tests need to configure cgroup
limits in files under /sys/fs/cgroup.

 $ sudo make -C tools/testing/selftests/sgx run_tests

Without sudo, SGX cgroup tests will be skipped.

On platforms with large Enclave Page Cache (EPC) and/or less cpu cores, you may
need adjust the timeout in 'settings' to avoid timeouts.

More details about kselftest framework can be found in
Documentation/dev-tools/kselftest.rst.

WITHOUT KSELFTEST FRAMEWORK
===========================

BUILD
-----

Build executable file "test_sgx" from this
directory(tools/testing/selftests/sgx/):

  $ make

RUN
---

Run all non-cgroup tests:

 $ ./test_sgx

To test SGX cgroup:

 $ sudo ./run_sgx_cg_selftests.sh

THE SGX CGROUP TEST SCRIPTS
===========================

Overview of the main cgroup test script
---------------------------------------

With different cgroups, the script (run_sgx_cg_selftests.sh) starts one or
multiple concurrent SGX selftests (test_sgx), each to run the
unclobbered_vdso_oversubscribed test case, which loads an enclave of EPC size
equal to the EPC capacity available on the platform. The script checks results
against the expectation set for each cgroup and reports success or failure.

The script creates 3 different cgroups at the beginning with following
expectations:

  1) small - intentionally small enough to fail the test loading an enclave of
             size equal to the capacity.

  2) large - large enough to run up to 4 concurrent tests but fail some if more
	     than 4 concurrent tests are run. The script starts 4 expecting at
	     least one test to pass, and then starts 5 expecting at least one
             test to fail.

  3) larger - limit is the same as the capacity, large enough to run lots of
	      concurrent tests. The script starts 8 of them and expects all
	      pass.  Then it reruns the same test with one process randomly
	      killed and usage checked to be zero after all processes exit.

The script also includes a test with low mem_cg limit (memory.max) and the
'large' sgx_epc limit to verify that the RAM used for per-cgroup reclamation is
charged to a proper mem_cg. To validate mem_cg OOM-kills processes when its
memory.max limit is reached due to SGX EPC reclamation, the script turns off
swapping before start, and turns swapping back on afterwards for this particular
test.

The helper script
------------------------------------------------------

To monitor the SGX cgroup settings and behaviors or trouble-shoot during
testing, the helper script, watch_misc_for_tests.sh, can be used to watch
relevant entries in cgroupfs files. For example, to watch the SGX cgroup
'current' counter changes during testing, run this in a separate terminal from
this directory:

  $ ./watch_misc_for_tests.sh current

For more details about SGX cgroups, see "Cgroup Support" in
Documentation/arch/x86/sgx.rst.

The scripts require cgroup v2 support. More details about cgroup v2 can be found
in Documentation/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.rst.
